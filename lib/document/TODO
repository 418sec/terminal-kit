OK	Text should be splitted in 2 class, one on top of TextBuffer (let's call it TextBox), one without (Text)
OK	Button should inherit from Text, most of Button code should move to Text, since it basically do exactly what Text needs do,
		only interactivity code should be moved to Button
	TextBox could be used for dynamic text, or user input text, over multiple lines
	Eventually some state-machine could be plugged to TextBox for automatic styling (e.g. markdown, syntax highlighter)
	TextBox would support viewport (scrolling)
OK	TextInput's label should not rely on TextBuffer, instead it should use Text
?	TextInput's input should rely on TextBox --> not sure if it really should
	TextInput should implement almost all of inline .inputField() feature

OK	TextBuffer: refacto of TextBuffer, using only one array of array of object: {char,filler,attr,misc}

OK	content/value uniformization: content relate to what is displayed, value to what we got (forms, etc)

	Optimization: when drawing upward, if possible, only redraw a Rect, not the whole buffer.
		The child pass the Rect of the modified area, the parent try to redraw only inside this Rect, and pass that Rect to its parent, and so on...
